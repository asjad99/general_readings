1. Insights from Stanford Prison Experiment Professor: 

People's behaviour is much predicted by the enviornment not as much by personalities. 
Hero's can be anyone. oridinary people. 
Some people only focus on bad memories of the past 
some people only focus about fears in the future.


2. Limitations are self-Imposed 

In a team setting or indidividually, what we beleive we can or cannot do is self imposed. However inspiration is a very very major thing.
